# 5023Y_intro_to_statistics

## Lesson 1 - Intro to stats (1)
### 30/01/2023
I created this repo and a linked R project (5023Y_intro_to_statistics)  
I created the script (intro_to_stats_1) where data was checked and played with informally  
I introduced the use of standard deviation and uncertainty (normal distribution and confidence intervals)  
Including an example of an appropriate write-up response

## Lesson 2 - Intro to linear models
### 12/02/2023
I created the script (intro_to_linear_models) where data was analysed  
I used means, confidence intervals, equal variance, outliers and with more standard deviation and normal distribution checking to analyse the data

## Lesson 3 - Testing and Power analysis
### 17/02/2023

I created the script (testing) where data was put through a Student's T-test and a Paired T-test.  
I learnt about effect sizes, error types 1 and 2 and experimental power and the value of repeatability, as well as how to tell R to find all experiments which are statistically different and how to compare estimates and confidence intervals within experiments.  
I learnt about power analysis which tells us the probability of making a type 2 error and Cohen's D which tells us the effect size.
