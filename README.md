# 5023Y_intro_to_statistics

## Lesson 1 - Intro to stats (1)
### 30/01/2023
I created this repo and a linked R project (5023Y_intro_to_statistics)  
I created the script (intro_to_stats_1) where data was checked and played with informally  
I introduced the use of standard deviation and uncertainty (normal distribution and confidence intervals)  
Including an example of an appropriate write-up response

## Lesson 2 - Intro to linear models
### 12/02/2023
I created the script (intro_to_linear_models) where data was analysed  
I used means, confidence intervals, equal variance, outliers and with more standard deviation and normal distribution checking to analyse the data

## Lesson 3 - Testing and Power analysis
### 17/02/2023

I created the script (testing) where data was put through a Student's T-test and a Paired T-test.  
I learnt about effect sizes, error types 1 and 2 and experimental power and the value of repeatability, as well as how to tell R to find all experiments which are statistically different and how to compare estimates and confidence intervals within experiments.  
I learnt about power analysis which tells us the probability of making a type 2 error and Cohen's D which tells us the effect size.

## Lesson 4 - Regression
### 24/02/2023

I created the script (regression) where janka (wood) data was put through a Pearson's R test and regression analysis where a means centered regression was looked at.  
I learnt about resisual variance plots and how to identify and place outliers in R and how to plot predicted values on a graph.  
  
## Lesson 5 - ANOVA
### 10/03/2023

I created the script (ANOVA) where Darwin data was put through an ANOVA and F-test which analyses the difference between groups and the F-test accounts for sample size as well.  
The activity used frog data to see how hatching is affected by temperature and ANOVA was used on the data.

## Lesson 6 - Mutlivariate liner models
### 17/03/2023

I created the script (multivariate_linear_models) where biomass data was put through a one-way ANOVA and a factorial linear model where the latter allows us to compare additive and interaction effects.  
I learnt that it's important to order predictors for unbalanced datasets as ANOVA calculates sequentially based off what order we give it.  
I also learnt about how to do a pairwise comparison to compare the data as part of its pair.  
The activity used pollution data and put it through a continuous linear model to create a simple model for continuous data.  

## Lesson 7 - Complex models
### 24/03/2023

I created the script (complex_models) where fruitfly data was displayed in plots to visual differences to test a hypothesis on how sleep and size affects longevity.   
I looked at designing models but I didn't understand this, so I need to ask about it further.  
I learnt how to check the co-linearity of models and how to transform data to better fit a model (or not), including BoxCox as well as going over simplifying models.  
Finally, I looked at using the emmeans function for post hoc comparisons of the data, including pairwise comparisons, and have an example of how a write up for statistics work would look like.

## Lesson 8 - Generalised linear models
### 2/04/2023

I created the script (generalised_linear_models) where fruitfly data was compared with a generalised linear model with a gaussian error distribution but I couldn't continue further because there is no data for cuckoo or challenger data.
